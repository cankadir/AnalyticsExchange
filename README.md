# AnalyticsExchange NYC OPEN DATA Visualization Presentation.
This notebook provides a set of data visualizations produced from the same data sourse (311 data).
The aim is to provide a tutorial for transforming data and choosing the right chart types.

Each chart is shown in a raw and finished format to display tricks in formatting charts.
